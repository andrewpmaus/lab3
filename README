A simple Digital Clock, reminiscent of the digital alarm clocks a mere decade ago.
Now that smart phones are so common, often your clock is replaced by your smartphone.
I feel that the smartphone lacks the ever-present feel of a digital alarm clock, with its soft, red glow in the dark of your room: unintrusive, but always present.
This clock reminds us of those times, and seeks to welcome you back with a familar style.

The clock is programmed with javascript and implemented with html and css.

Future additions will include an alarm function with snooze button and loud annoying beep that wakes up the neighbors and roommates.
